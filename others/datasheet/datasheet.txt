1. Dataset Overview
-	Title: Processed Analysis Data of Red-Light Camera Fines
-	Description: This dataset contains fines data collected from red-light cameras across multiple regions in Toronto, with variables processed and transformed for analysis. It includes yearly fine trends, enforcement start times, and ward-specific details in both long and wide formats.
-	Source: The original raw data was sourced from Open Data Toronto (https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/red-light-camera-annual-charges/).

2. Data Collection Process
-	Data Origin: Observational data automatically collected by red-light cameras.
-	Sampling Strategy: Near-complete census of all monitored red-light camera locations in Toronto from 2007 to 2024.
-	Collection Timeframe: 2007-2024.
-	Data Units: Each row in the long-format dataset represents a yearly observation of fines for a specific red-light camera location and ward.

3. Variables and Metadata

Wide Format Dataset (analysis_data.parquet):
-	`Location_Code` (Numeric): Unique identifier for each red-light camera location.
-	`Ward_Number` (Character): Ward where the red-light camera is located (1â€“25).
-	`Enforcement_Start_Date` (Date): Date when enforcement began at the location.
-	`Year_2007` to `Year_2024` (Numeric): Fines issued annually.

Long Format Dataset (analysis_data_long.parquet):

-	`Location_Code` (Numeric): Same as above.
-	`Ward_Number` (Character): Same as above.
-	`Year` (Numeric): Year of the observation.
-	`Fines` (Numeric): Total fines issued in that year.
-	`Enforcement_Start_Date` (Date): Same as above.
-	`Enforcement` (Binary): Indicator of whether enforcement was active (1) or not (0).

Constructed Variables:

Enforcement was derived by comparing Enforcement_Start_Date with the corresponding year to determine whether enforcement was active.

Missing Data Handling:

Missing data in year columns were replaced with 0 fines to ensure completeness for analysis.

4. Intended Use
-	Purpose: This dataset was processed to study the effect of enforcement start time and regional variations on fine trends.
-	Target Audience: Researchers, policymakers, and traffic safety analysts.
-	Potential Applications:
	-	Analyzing trends in fines over time.
	-	Evaluating the effectiveness of red-light enforcement policies.
	-	Regional comparisons of enforcement outcomes.

5. Limitations and Ethical Considerations
-	Known Biases: Regional selection biases may exist due to prioritization of high-risk areas for red-light cameras. Temporal effects, such as changes in traffic volume or socioeconomic factors, are not included.
-	Limitations: Fines are the sole outcome variable; other metrics such as accident rates or compliance rates are not available. No data on broader contextual changes, such as construction projects or seasonal variations.
-	Ethical Considerations: The dataset does not include personally identifiable information (PII), ensuring privacy compliance.
